Traditional versions of casual games like *Flappy Bird* offer only a basic single‑player loop, which limits replayability and long‑term engagement. Most clones lack competitive elements, AI challenges, multiplayer, or social features. Players quickly lose interest without difficulty progression, variety, or learning opponents.

This project addresses those gaps by adding multiple game modes, AI‑powered opponents with configurable difficulty, real‑time multiplayer, and a competitive leaderboard. The result is a modern, feature‑rich experience designed to sustain player interest with diverse gameplay and social competition.

## Key features

1. Build a feature‑rich Flappy Bird with multiple modes (classic, AI challenge, Man‑vs‑Machine, multiplayer).
2. Implement NEAT‑based AI opponents with configurable difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard/Extreme).
3. Provide real‑time multiplayer (host/client) for competitive play.
4. Add registration and login for personalized experiences.
5. Integrate a global leaderboard backed by MongoDB.
6. Include an AI demonstration/training flow to showcase learning over generations.
